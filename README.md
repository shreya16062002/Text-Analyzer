# Text-Analyzer
Implemented Semantic and Syntactic Analysis, Tokenization, and Summarization features. Utilized Python libraries to deliver accurate text analysis functionalities and used Streamlit for a user friendly interface
HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT-
STEP 1- MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYTHON AND PYCHARM INSTALLED IN YOUR SYSTEM.
STEP 2- OPEN THE PROJECT FOLDER USING PYCHARM. (PLEASE PASTE THE FOLDER IN THE PYCHARM FOLDER OF YOUR SYSTEM)
STEP 3- OPEN THE PYCHARM TERMINAL AND RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS TO DOWNLOAD THE REQUIRED PACKAGES:
pip install streamlit spacy textblob nltk sumy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
STEP 4-SET UP A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
Go to File -> Settings -> Project -> Python Interpreter. Click on the gear icon and select "Add..." to create a new virtual environment.
STEP 5- CONFIGURE PYCHARM RUN CONFIGURATION :
In the top-right corner of PyCharm, you'll see a dropdown menu with configurations. Click on it and select "Edit Configurations...". Click on the '+' icon to add a new configuration and choose "Python". Set the following configurations:
Script: Path to your Streamlit script (the file where your code is located).
Script parameters: None
Python interpreter: Select the interpreter from the virtual environment you created.
STEP 6- DEBUG THE PROJECT
RIGHT CLICK ON THE CODE AND SELECT THE OPTION DEBUG OR PRESS Shift+F9 TO RUN THE SCRIPT IN DEBUG MODE.
STEP 7- RUN THE PROJECT 
A COMMAND WILL APPEAR IN THE DEBUG CONSOLE AFTER THE DEBUGGING IS FINISHED . (eg- streamlit run C:\Users\91982\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\test.py )
JUST COPY THE COMMAND AND PASTE IT ON THE TERMINAL AND IT WILL REDIRECT YOU TO THE APPLICATION
STEP 8-USE THE APPLICATION
PyCharm will open a new tab in your default web browser with the Streamlit app.
You can interact with the web application by entering text into the text box and clicking on the provided buttons for different analyses (Tokenization, Syntactic Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Summarization).
